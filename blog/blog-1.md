# Blog 1: Election Morning

## Retrospect
I remember where I was four years ago.
At about 5pm I checked my phone to see the numbers roll in after having avoided the news most of the day.

I was at a meeting, along with the rest of the Interns at the Gender Equity Resource Center on campus. I don't remember what the topic of conversation was, but I do remember feeling the pang of uncertainty, the color leave my face, my stomach drop.

I was an RA, and had planned a watch party for that night. So certain that we'd be welcoming another Clinton, I didn't even consider the idea of anything else happening. It was going to be a celebration.

As you can guess, it was not. I half-heartedly frosted sugar cookies with blue and red frosting and star sprinkles. I hauled several gallons of soda to our communal TV room and hoped that maybe things would turn around. But the last thing I remember of that day was sitting with my best friend, feebly making jokes so that they would stop crying. From that day forward, the chamber of my heart that held any specter of emotions about the political world was locked.

It held for almost four years. I've been mostly able to avoid feeling anything since then, out of pure fear and avoidance. The walls of that chamber are thick and strong, and I've muscled through so many crises and so much bizarreness.

Yesterday, however, the walls broke. Finally, after four years of learning to open my eyes to the world, after nine months of sheltering-in-place, after one well-meaning meeting at work about how to cope with all of this, I broke down.

I haven't cried like that in a long time. I'm honestly a bit afraid to admit this, here, but I will anyway because I firmly believe that getting through this requires each of us to push ourselves to be vulnerable with each other. I cried. Hard. Nothing had changed other than my realization that I'd been repressing so much. I'm still processing it, but it's a feeling unlike anything I've experienced before. How does one describe 48 months' worth of emotions rushing in at once after so many years of festering and simmering? (Trauma soup, anyone?)

What will tonight bring? A Democratic win would ease the suffering of some (probably primarily white, cis, straight, abled, etc) folks, but what then? How will we keep our momentum? A Republican victory, who knows? How will we continue to fight? Of course, I'm no political expert, not even close.

What I do know is that I don't know. We cannot definitively predict the future. But I hope that we are able to create a radically good world.
